[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NoellZane/Testing-REST-endpoints.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NoellZane/Testing-REST-endpoints)
Just had to remake repo, hopefully this all still works.
All the mandatory exercises are done.
Added all the JSDay 1 files in a seperate folder in the root. 
The Exercises from day 2 are on HTML pages, with links in the nav bar. 
I will also add the link to the repo with all the projects in seperate files.
